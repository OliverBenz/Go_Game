# Camera Tuner Application
App to help the user tune the camera position, environmental factors, and algorithm parameters to allow for the Go board detection algorithm to function properly.

## Purpose
- Given an input image or video stream, visualize each step in the board detection algorithm.
- Allow to tune the default parameters of each step in the algorithm.

Now the algorithm is impferfect so also tune your camera position and lighting to help it out.
